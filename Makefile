## Run checks and tests for the `prompt-env.sh` script, including dependency management.

## The intent of this file is to be a "zero-configuration" automation script, where any setup or dependency installation that needs to be done is taken care of by this script.
## While there may be issues to be solved along the way, the desired end result is to able to perform the following steps:
## 1. Clone this repository
## 2. `make checks`
## and then have all tests and code checks run for the project, without needing to manually install or configure dependencies.
##
## Pursuant to the above, we make the assumption that you either have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh} installed, or are willing to have it installed for you, as that is the way that dependency management is performed for this automation script.
##
## This file is primarily a convenience for interactive usage, and as such does not have a public API for integrating with other scripts.
## However, the current targets and their functions are provided below:
## - setup:                   install all needed dependecies for running checks
## - test:                    run all tests of the `prompt-env.sh` script
## - coverage-json, coverage: generate the JSON coverage report, exiting with a failure code if not 100% covered
## - coverage-html:           generate the HTML coverage report and open it with the system-registered program
## - lint:                    run all lint checks of the `prompt-env.sh` script
## - clean, clean-all:        remove all generated files
