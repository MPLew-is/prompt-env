## Usage:
## ```sh
## shunit2 end-to-end.sh
## ```

# Create a per-test-case temporary directory inside the script-level one (created by `shunit2`) to isolate test cases from each other.
# This is probably overkill since the helper functions below clean up the individual files they create, but this provides a strong guarantee of isolation even on failure or for future parallelization.
# This function is called automatically by `shunit2` before each test case is run.
setUp() {
	testTemporaryDirectory="$(mktemp -d "${SHUNIT_TMPDIR}/XXXXXX")"
}

# Clean up the temporary directory for the just-finished test case.
# This function is called automatically by `shunit2` after each test case completes.
tearDown() {
	# Explicitly unset the per-test temporary directory, to ensure it doesn't leak into the next test.
	# The directory itself will be cleaned by `shunit2`, so there's no need to do anything else.
	unset testTemporaryDirectory
}

# Declare some dummy functions to prevent strange interactions between `bashcov` and `shunit2` when a function is being dynamically looked up and exists only in `shunit2`.
# It seems that `shunit2`'s lookup functionality breaks `bashcov`'s instrumentation redirection, leading to that output being printed to the console and not picked to indicate a hit line for coverage.
# By defining dummy functions, the coverage issues go away and `shunit2` seems to perform exactly the same.
oneTimeSetUp() {
	true
}
oneTimeTearDown() {
	true
}
# The fact that this does not cause issues running the tests is probably a bug, as `shunit2` says defining this will override its built-in test-function detection.
suite() {
	true
}


# Get the name of the command that invoked this script, so that the script under test can be invoked the same way.
# This is needed because the shell code coverage tools are tightly coupled to `bash` introspection features and `source`ing the script while under test seems to produce strange errors.

# All of the below test cases are in the format:
# ```sh
# 0<<-'INPUT' 3<<-'EXPECTED' promptEnvDiff {arguments}
#     {some input value}
# INPUT
#     {some expected value}
# EXPECTED
# ```
#
# This formatting is probably a little esoteric, so here's the general overview:
# - `{number}<<`: create [a here-doc](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/here-docs.html) on the file descriptor given by `{number}`, allowing us to specify raw input directly at this command instead of having to deal with storing multi-line strings in a variable and then echoing them.
# - `{number}<<-`: create a here-doc as above that ignores leading spacing so that the contents can be indented for code-formmating purposes.
# - `{number}<<-'STRING'`: use 'STRING' as the delimiter for the end of the heredoc, and do not attempt to expand variables or other shell commands found in its contents (strictly treat the here-doc as text).
#
# Thus, anything between the command and `INPUT` is what's fed over file descriptor 0 (`stdin`) to `prompt-env`, and anything between `INPUT` and `EXPECTED` is what's fed over file descriptor 3 as the 'expected' output from `prompt-env` to the given input and arguments.
# Additionally, by making the diff invocation the last command in the function, its status is automatically returned as the output of the function so that `shunit2` can correctly show failures; if more complex test cases are needed, that status will need to be stored and explicitly `return`ed.
# All functions (such as the ones below) that start with `test` are considered test cases by `shunit2`; simply add new functions matching that format to add new tests.
